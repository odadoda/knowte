Wordpress theme for easely accessing your notes.

Do you have a text-file on your harddrive with usefull notes you use every now and then? Do you use "cmd+f" to find your usefull notes in that file? Well I did. And I felt pitiful and ugly every time I did. That is what this theme is a sollution to. Storing and categorising and finding all my uncomplete ramblings i might need later. Searching quickly both in tags and text. But wait. Handy notes to myself on sie internet? All public, for everyone to see, and to pour their frantic rage upon? Yes my sweet friends. Yes because you should to. Create your own place with bad html and weird jquery scripts. 

The search input field match on title as well as content text on keyup. All tags are available in the datalist of the input field. If you hit enter you will be directed to that tag page (tag/inputtext).

Mostly in norwegian.
